# Simon-Game

The objective of the Simon game is to replicate a sequence of light and sound patterns that the game generates. It starts with a simple pattern of one button, and with each successful repetition, the pattern becomes progressively longer and more complex. The game continues until the player makes a mistake by pressing the wrong button or failing to replicate the pattern correctly. The console keeps track of the player's score by playing a unique sound for each successful round.
